US vote 2020 monitoring scripts
======

A collection of scripts I wrote for monitoring the 2020 US presidential vote.

These scripts take input from theguardian website.

 * lc.py  - summarize per county info
 * ls.py  - summarize per state info
 * run.py

Older variants:

 * counties.py
 * stateinfo.py
 * vote2020.py
